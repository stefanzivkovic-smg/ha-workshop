## Lab: ASP.NET Web App Download Artifact

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a GitHub Actions workflow to **download artifacts** generated by a previous workflow. This demonstrates the use of the `actions/download-artifact` action to retrieve stored artifacts for further use, such as deploying an ASP.NET Web Application.

> **Duration**: 15-20 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure that:

1. You have completed the [ASP.NET Web App Upload Artifact Lab](./upload-artifact-lab.md).
2. The **ASP.NET Web App Build - Upload Artifact Workflow** is functional and uploads the artifact named `aspnet-web-app`.

Refer to the [ASP.NET Web App Download Artifact Starter](./download-artifact-starter.md) file for the initial workflow content.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a YAML Workflow Using the Starter File

1. Refer to the [**ASP.NET Web App Download Artifact Starter File**](./download-artifact-starter.md).
2. Copy the content of the starter file:

   ```yaml
   name: ASP.NET Web App Download Artifact

   on:
     workflow_dispatch:

   jobs:
     build-and-upload:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       defaults:
         run:
           working-directory: ./src/dotnet/WebApp
       steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.7

         - name: Set up .NET Core
           uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4.0.1
           with:
             dotnet-version: '8.x'

         - name: Build Code
           run: dotnet build --configuration Release

         - name: Publish Code
           run: dotnet publish -c Release --property:PublishDir="${{runner.temp}}/webapp"

         - name: Upload Artifact
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.3.6
           with:
             name: aspnet-web-app # Artifact name
             path: ${{runner.temp}}/webapp
   ```

3. In your repository, create a new workflow file under `.github/workflows` and name it `aspnet-webapp-download-artifact.yml`.
4. Paste the copied content into the new file.
5. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

---

### Step 2: Add Additional Steps for Verification

1. Open the `aspnet-webapp-download-artifact.yml` file.
2. Add new job to download the artifact and list its contents:

   ```yaml
   download:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: build-and-upload
     steps:
       - name: Download Artifact
         uses: actions/download-artifact@v4.1.8
         with:
           name: aspnet-web-app # Artifact name
       - name: List Files in Artifact
         run: |
           ls -al
         shell: bash
   ```

---

### Step 3: Verify the Complete Workflow File

Ensure your `aspnet-webapp-download-artifact.yml` file matches the following:

```yaml
name: ASP.NET Web App - Download Artifact

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/aspnet-webapp-download-artifact.yml'
      - 'src/dotnet/WebApp/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./src/dotnet/WebApp
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.7

      - name: Set up .NET Core
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4.0.1
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.x'

      - name: Build Code
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release

      - name: Publish Code
        run: dotnet publish -c Release --property:PublishDir="${{runner.temp}}/webapp"

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.3.6
        with:
          name: aspnet-web-app # Artifact name
          path: ${{runner.temp}}/webapp
          retention-days: 7 # Number of days to keep the artifact. Default is 90 days or configured value in the repository settings -> Actions permissions -> Artifact and logs retention

  download:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-upload
    steps:
      - name: Download Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4.1.8
        with:
          name: aspnet-web-app # Artifact name
      - name: List Files in Artifact
        run: |
          ls -al
        shell: bash
```

---

### Step 4: Commit and Push the Workflow File

1. Save the changes to the `aspnet-webapp-download-artifact.yml` file.
2. Commit the updated file with a descriptive message, e.g., `"Added workflow for downloading build artifact"`.
3. Push the changes to your repository.

---

### Step 5: Trigger and Run the Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Manually trigger the **ASP.NET Web App Download Artifact** workflow via the **workflow_dispatch** event.
3. Monitor the workflow run and ensure the `download` job executes successfully.

---

### Step 6: Verify the Downloaded Artifact

1. Review the logs of the **List Downloaded Files** step to confirm that the artifact contents are correctly saved in the `downloaded-artifacts` directory.
2. Use the **Verify Artifact Content** step logs to ensure the artifact matches the expected build output.

---

## Summary

In this lab, you created a GitHub Actions workflow to download artifacts uploaded by a previous workflow using the `actions/download-artifact` action. You verified the downloaded files and learned how to use them for subsequent steps in a CI/CD pipeline.
